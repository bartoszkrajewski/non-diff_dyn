Dynamics of quantum systems is typically very fast as compared to the time-scales which
are relevant for our everyday experience. In particular, the relaxation times in solids with strong
electronic correlations may be of the order of a few tens of femtoseconds. At longer time, quantum
systems approach their thermal equilibrium. And yet there are systems where the relaxation may be
slowed down by many orders of magnitude or even completely eliminated. Approaching the thermal
equilibrium unavoidably implies the loss of information concerning the initial quantum state.
Therefore, methods of avoiding or slowing down the thermalization might be important for the
future applications which will be based on processing of quantum information. However first of all,
understanding such unusually slow dynamics represents an interesting challenge, that may be
important for diverse branches of physics, e.g., for the condensed matter physics and the statistical
physics.

In general, there are a few categories of quantum many-body systems relevant for the
absence of thermalization or for a very slow thermalization: scarred models which don’t thermalize
for very rare but still physically relevant initial states; quantum time crystals where time-translation
symmetry is broken for typical states; disordered systems with many-body interactions (DSMB)
and quantum integrable models (IM). The research on the unconventional dynamics of quantum
systems is by far dominated by the theoretical studies, hence it is important to focus on problems
for which there exist experimental data. From among the systems listed above, the strongest
experimental evidence has been established so far for the DSMB where the ultraslow dynamics or
the absence of thermalization are generic and occur without fine-tuning of the model parameters.
On the one hand, theoretical predictions suggest that absence of thermalization is possible only in
1D systems. On the other hand, the experiments show signatures of localization also in twodimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Thus, the dynamics of strongly disordered
systems beyond 1D remains largely an open problem that is relevant for experimental studies. This
problem is also the main motivation for the theoretical studies covered by the present project.
 
The present understanding of the DSMB is built upon rather straightforward numerical
method. While these methods provided several milestone results concerning 1D DSMB, purely
numerical methods may be insufficient for solving problems motivated by the existing experiments,
in particular concerning transport in disordered 2D systems. In order to overcome this problem we
will follow a twofold strategy based on a combination of a simplified approaches (to go beyond the
limitations of the standard numerical methods) and investigations based on the Eigenstate
Thermalization Hypothesis, ETH, (to get deeper understanding of the nonergodicity in strongly
disordered DSMB). Within the former part, we will develop and study simplified approaches to
transport in DSMB. In particular, we will use approximate methods (e.g., semiclassical rate
equations) and study effective Hamiltonians. Such studies give reliable bounds on the transport
properties in quasi-2D and 2D systems. One of the most general and universal view on
thermalization is based on the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The DSMB and IM
may seem to be very different, however they share a common important property: they do not obey
ETH. This raises a question about similarities and difference between IM and DSMB with respect
to the violation of the ETH, which we will study within this project. This part of our proposal is
higher-risk and higher-impact research which goes beyond problems specific for DSMB. A detailed
understanding of the transition between regimes where ETH is fulfilled and where it is violated is
missing. Such understanding is important not only from the perspective of DSMB but also IM.
